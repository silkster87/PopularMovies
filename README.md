This is a first project for the Udacity Android Development Nanodegree. Special care has been taken not to publish my API Key!

In order to get this to work once you have cloned it, you need to put your API key gradle.properties file in the project. More details: https://richardroseblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/29/hiding-secret-api-keys-from-git/

Get your API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/
